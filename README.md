# tribute-page-project

This tribute page is one of the required projects in freeCodeCamp for the HTML/CSS web design certification. This particular project was to expirement with building a website from start to finish while setting the correct properties to make it resize responsively across devices. I found that the actual content layout of this site was not too difficult, I was more tested on my CSS and positioning skills. I enjoyed creating this, one because Marie Curie was an amazing women who deserves all the credit and two because the layout and content are so simple but I had to really play around with the sizing and spacing properties and adjust as I went. Overall, this was a fun and simple project that tested me on my responsive web design skills. Take a look at my final code!
